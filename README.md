# JavaScript Quiz

## Coded By: Peter Janasz

## Description
Created a JavaScript Quiz using multiple html, CSS, and JS files. Created query selectors, functions, and arrays using object-oriented programming to create "Start", "Question", "End Quiz", and "High Scores" screens.

Stored user score to localStorage and rendered the data onto the high scores page.

Created button to clear screen and links to navigate between quiz and high score html pages.
